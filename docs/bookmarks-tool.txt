" NAME
"     my-bookmarks.nvim - A Neovim plugin for managing file bookmarks with
"     Telescope integration.
"
" SYNOPSIS
"     :NewBookmark [description]
"     :BookmarkGlobal
"     :BookmarkScoped
"
" DESCRIPTION
"     my-bookmarks.nvim is a minimalistic bookmark manager for Neovim that leverages
"     Telescope for searching and opening bookmarks. Bookmarks include:
"
"         - File path, line and column (the cursor position when the bookmark is
"           created)
"         - An optional description
"         - The project (the working directory where the bookmark was created)
"         - A creation timestamp (a Unix timestamp)
"         - A unique 6-character alphanumeric id
"
"     Bookmarks are stored in a user-configurable Lua file, which allows for easy
"     version control and manual editing.
"
" COMMANDS
"
"     :NewBookmark [description]
"         Create a new bookmark at the current cursor position.
"
"         You may specify a description with:
"
"             :NewBookmark description="Your bookmark description"
"
"         If no description is provided, the bookmark is created without one.
"
"     :BookmarkGlobal
"         Open a Telescope picker to search through all bookmarks.
"
"     :BookmarkScoped
"         Open a Telescope picker to search bookmarks in the current working
"         directory.
"
" TELESCOPE PICKER KEY BINDINGS
"
"     When the Telescope picker is open:
"
"         <Enter>   - Open the selected bookmark's file at the saved line and
"                     column.
"         <C-d>     - Delete the selected bookmark.
"         <C-e>     - Edit the selected bookmark's description.
"
"     After editing or deleting a bookmark, the picker automatically refreshes
"     the list to reflect changes.
"
" CONFIGURATION
"
"     Users can override the default configuration by calling the setup function.
"     For example, to set a custom bookmarks directory, add the following to your
"     init.lua:
"
"         require('my_bookmarks').setup({
"             bookmarks_dir = "/path/to/bookmarks"
"         })
"
"     The 'bookmarks_dir' option specifies the directory where the bookmarks
"     file (bookmarks.lua) is stored.
"
" FILE STORAGE FORMAT
"
"     Bookmarks are stored in a Lua file (bookmarks.lua) in the configured
"     directory. The file is a Lua table with each entry following this format:
"
"         {
"           id          = "a1B2c3",
"           file        = "/path/to/file.lua",
"           line        = 42,
"           col         = 10,
"           description = "Bookmark description",
"           project     = "/path/to/project",
"           timestamp   = 1672531200,
"         },
"
"     This format is human-readable and allows you to manually edit or commit
"     the file to version control.
"
" INSTALLATION
"
"     Using Lazy (LazyVim) as a package manager, add the following to your
"     configuration:
"
"         {
"           "gustavofsantos/bookmarks-tool.nvim",
"           config = function()
"             require("bookmarks").setup({
"               bookmarks_dir = vim.fn.expand("~/.config/nvim/bookmarks")
"             })
"           end,
"         }
