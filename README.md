# Bookmarks Tool

This is a file bookmarking tool to keep track of important files in large codebases.

The design philosophy of this plugin is to solve the following problem.

> I need to work on several massive projects, where it's easy to lost track of where files are.
> so that with this plugin I can make annotations in multiple places in the same file and
> browse the annotations as bookmarks. Commiting my bookmarking file to a secure place is a must
> because I cannot depend on my working PC not failing.
